# Sablier V2 ü§ù Exactly Protocol

This repository contains several Forge scripts developed by the Sablier Labs team for Exactly Protocol. The scripts
generate Lockup Dynamic segments that emulate a polynomial function.

## Polynomial

The polynomial function emulated is:

```math
f(x) = -0.0001*x^2 + 0.7161*x + 8.0377
```

## Usage

Run the script like this, making sure to replace `ETH_FROM` with your wallet address:

```sh
# your address here
ETH_FROM=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
forge script script/ExactlySchedule.s.sol \
--broadcast \
--ledger \
--mnemonic-derivation-paths  "m/44'/60'/0'/0" \
--rpc-url optimism \
--sig "run()" \
--verify \
--with-gas-price $(cast to-wei 5 gwei) \
-vvvv
```

## Helpers

Part of the Solidity code has been generated using the Python scripts located in the [data](/data) directory.

## Notes

- Run `foundryup` to ensure that you are running the latest version of Foundry
- The command above assumes that you are using a Ledger wallet connected to a computer via USB. If you wish to use a
  mnemonic instead, you can set it as a `$MNEMONIC` environment variable in a `.env` file. Check out the
  [`Base`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/d1157b49ed4bceeff0c4e437c9f723e88c134d3a/test/Base.t.sol)
  script.
